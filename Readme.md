## International Global Icon Knock-Out 2k14: A Javascript Turn-Based Game
* This was my first attempt at making a turn based game, styled in honor of old school NES and SNES punch-out games
* I used Jquery, and Underscore, specifically making prototypes and instances to generate my characters.
* To use, run bower and npm installs, and gulp..
